Punkto Application


# Golden Rules

1. All Code MUST HAVE a corresponding test (100% test coverage required)
2. Common code MUST be placed in a "common" folder to be shared with other apps
3. LESS should be used and not CSS
4. All methods, classes and properties MUST be properly documented using JSDoc comments
5. All code MUST conform to the style guide
6. All code MUST pass tests with 100% coverage before they will be accepted

# Setup

1. run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
2. cd into build-tools and run `npm install` (DO NOT USE sudo!)

# Running

| Action  | Command           |
|---------|-------------------|
| test    | `grunt test`      |
| serve   | `grunt serve`     |
| build   | `grunt build`     |
